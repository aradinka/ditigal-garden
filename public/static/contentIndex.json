There are 5 core principles that can help optimize prompts to make AI models more useful, reliable, and safe.\n1. Give Clear Direction §\nBrief the AI on exactly what you’re looking for. Providing context through instructions, role-playing, and seed words guides the model to generate outputs that match your vision. As the author explains, “A human would also struggle without a good brief.”\n2. Specify the Format §\nDefine the structure you want upfront. Specify JSON, comma-separated, image size, etc. This makes responses easier to parse and spot errors.\n3. Use Representative Examples §\nShow, don’t just tell. Include examples that demonstrate what you want without being overly restrictive. Curate your examples to improve results over time.\n4. Evaluate and Refine §\nTest prompts variants to identify issues. Simple approaches like thumbs up/down ratings help iterate and boost reliability.\n5. Divide Complex Tasks §\nChain together specialized prompts. Splitting prompts makes sophisticated tasks more manageable. Select the right model per task.\nThe Future of Work with AI §\nAs the author explains, these principles mirror management practices for human workers. Prompt engineering ultimately improves communication between humans and AI.\n\n“Prompt engineering develops the core skills for working professionally with AI.”\n\nWith more models on the horizon, prompt engineering will likely grow as a key job skill. Mastering these principles helps create reliable, productive relationships between humans and artificial intelligence."}}
