    <description>Previous research: Clouds could reduce the amount of usable data. It‚Äôs hard to find an ideal pair of Landsat images that are free of clouds, cloud shadows and snow Previous change detection algorithm over shorter time intervals has a limitations.</description>

    <guid>https:/quartz.jzhao.xyz/Phenology-and-sun-angle-differences-in-landsat-data</guid>
    <description> Phenology: Refers to the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena, especially in relation to climate and plant and animal life. In the context of Landsat data, phenology affects the imagery because different seasons show varying characteristics of vegetation, water bodies, and other land features.</description>

    <guid>https:/quartz.jzhao.xyz/Natural-and-Anthropogenic-Land-Cover-Change</guid>
    <description> Definition: Land cover change refers to the transformation of the physical and biological cover of the earth‚Äôs surface. Natural Causes: Climate Change: Alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns can transform landscapes, such as turning forests into grasslands.</description>
