    <guid>https:/quartz.jzhao.xyz/ESRI-2020-Land-Cover</guid>
    <description>It was developed using Sentinel-2 imagery with a 10 m resolution and deep learning methods. The forest class is coded as 2 and defined as dense vegetation clustering of trees taller than 15 m, typically with a closed or dense canopy.</description>

    <guid>https:/quartz.jzhao.xyz/A-Comparison-of-Six-Forest-Mapping-Products-in-Southeast-Asia</guid>
    <description>Forest Mapping Comparison.pdf Introduction ¬ß Forest mapping products utilized for monitor and assess the status and changes in forests. However, substantial disparities exist among these products due to variations in forest definitions, classification methods, and data source.</description>

    <guid>https:/quartz.jzhao.xyz/Phenology-and-sun-angle-differences-in-landsat-data</guid>
    <description> Phenology: Refers to the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena, especially in relation to climate and plant and animal life. In the context of Landsat data, phenology affects the imagery because different seasons show varying characteristics of vegetation, water bodies, and other land features.</description>
