The opening of the Landsat archive in 2008 (Woodcock et al., 2008) has led to big changes.

One of the drawbacks of Landsat data is the relatively low temporal frequency. For each Landsat sensor, overpasses of the same location occur every 16 days, and data at this temporal frequency are only common within the United States where the sensors are turned on for every overpass.
