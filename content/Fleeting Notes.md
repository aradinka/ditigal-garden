In the context of the [[Zettelkasten]] method, "fleeting notes" refer to brief, temporary notes that capture initial thoughts, ideas, or observations. These notes are typically taken quickly and without much detail, serving as a way to capture fleeting thoughts before they are forgotten. 

Fleeting notes are meant to be temporary and are later processed into more coherent and organized notes within the [[Zettelkasten]] system.
