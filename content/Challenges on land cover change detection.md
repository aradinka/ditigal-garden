title: Challenges on land cover change detection

Previous research:
- Clouds could reduce the amount of usable data. It's hard to find an ideal pair of [[Landsat]] images that are free of clouds, cloud shadows and snow
- Previous change detection algorithm over shorter time intervals has a limitations. To minimize the influences of [[Phenology and sun angle differences in landsat data]], the ideal images should fall within the same season
