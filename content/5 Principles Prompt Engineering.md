title: 5 Principles Prompt Engineering
---
Prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial skill for getting the most out of AI tools. There are 5 core principles that can help optimize prompts to make AI models more useful, reliable, and safe.

###### 1. Give Clear Direction

*Brief the AI on exactly what you're looking for.* Providing context through instructions, role-playing, and seed words guides the model to generate outputs that match your vision. As the author explains, **"A human would also struggle without a good brief."**

###### 2. Specify the Format

*Define the structure you want upfront.* Specify JSON, comma-separated, image size, etc. This **makes responses easier to parse and spot errors.**

###### 3. Use Representative Examples

*Show, don't just tell.* Include examples that demonstrate what you want without being overly restrictive. Curate your examples to improve results over time.

###### 4. Evaluate and Refine

*Test prompts variants to identify issues.* Simple approaches like thumbs up/down ratings help **iterate and boost reliability.** 

###### 5. Divide Complex Tasks

*Chain together specialized prompts.* Splitting prompts **makes sophisticated tasks more manageable.** Select the right model per task.

###### The Future of Work with AI

As the author explains, these principles mirror management practices for human workers. **Prompt engineering ultimately improves communication between humans and AI.**

>*"Prompt engineering develops the core skills for working professionally with AI."*

With more models on the horizon, prompt engineering will likely grow as a key job skill. Mastering these principles helps create reliable, productive relationships between humans and artificial intelligence.
