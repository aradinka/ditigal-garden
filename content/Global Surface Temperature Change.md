It is a collaborative effort between the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) lab at the University of Maryland, Google, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 

Tree cover is defined as all vegetation taller than 5 m, including both natural forests and planted forests that meet the criteria. 

The spatial resolution is 30 m, and the tree cover is represented as a percentage from 1% to 100%. 

The data are derived from Landsat 7 reflectance measurements obtained during the growing season. Over 600,000 Landsat 7 images were analyzed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to accurately classify and supervise tree cover at the pixel level.
