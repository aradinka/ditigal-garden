The Zettelkasten method is a note-taking and knowledge management system that was developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The term "Zettelkasten" translates to "slip box" in English. 

The method involves using a collection of individual notes, or "Zettel," which are small, self-contained units of information. Each note represents a single idea, concept, or piece of knowledge. These notes are typically written on index cards or in a digital format.

The Zettelkasten method emphasizes the interconnectedness of ideas and encourages the creation of links between related notes. The notes are organized in a non-linear, associative manner, allowing for easy retrieval and connection of information.

The key principles of the Zettelkasten method include:
1. Atomicity: Each note should represent a single, concise idea or piece of information.
2. Interconnectedness: Notes should be linked to other relevant notes to create a network of connections and associations.
3. Incremental growth: The Zettelkasten grows gradually over time as new notes are added and connected to existing ones.         
4. Personalization: The system should be adapted to suit individual preferences and needs.					
The Zettelkasten method is often used for research, writing, and knowledge management, as it helps to organize and structure information in a way that facilitates understanding, creativity, and the generation of new ideas.
